As camera 1 and camera 2 are symmetric around the z axis (camera 1 is x-z, camera 2 is y-z), then by finding the center
of joint 1, we can find the exact point of symmetry. In an ideal world, where joint 1 would be perfectly centered in both
cameras, the axis of symmetry would be the z axis itself.

However, knowing that:
1. Joint 1 is not moving
2. Joint 1 is perfectly visible from both cameras
3. Joint 1 as seen in Camera 1 rotated around z axis should give us Joint 1 as seen in Camera 2

We can find the axis of symmetry outside of runtime & fix it from the beginning.

From camera 1, the Pixel co-ordinates for Joint 1 are: [419, 535]
From camera 2, the Pixel co-ordinates for Joint 1 are: [342, 536]
As such, our [0,0,0] point is [340,420,545] and we have a Z-axis correction factor of -1 pixels for Camera_2

This is important because now, knowing the length of all joints we can:
1. use either camera to find the "height" [z-axis co-ordinate] of each blob
2. we need one more co-ordinate to find the full position of each joint - this can be taken either from camera 1 or camera 2

E.G. the robot has moved in such a way that leg 3 is parallel to the x axis (i.e. camera 1 looking into the yz plane does not distinguish the link at all)
and leg 2 is parallel to the y axis (i.e. camera 2 looking into the xz plane does not distinguish the link at all), we are still able to find the vector representing
the link accurately.

I.e. We follow the steps (starting for link 2):
0. Define a GLOBAL frame of reference - [where 0,0,0] is for both cameras so that co-ordinates can be invariant to the camera
1. For start & end blobs we find the camera that sees most pixels of the blob.
2. We select the camera that sees the most pixels (alternatively, apply chaffer with circular balls and take best fit)
3. We find the center of each blob co-ordinates on that camera in that global frame of reference

I.e. use Cam1 for Yellow & it's [X, -10, 20]
Now we use Cam2 for blue: [-10, Y, 20]

We know the following:
[X-0]**2 + [Y+10]**2 + 400 = L

However, we know that Link 1 is fixed & as such, yellow is fixed at x =0 and we can eliminate one DOF.

This is important because we can enforce the fixed nature of Link 1 to be able to only need 1 camera reading per blob.

This approach results into the following:

Joint1 = Fixed for Q1
Joint2 = After finding Position of Blue -> Project on to X-axis -> [angle between X-axis & projection - Math.PI/2]
Joint3 = After finding Position of Blue -> Project on to Y-axis -> [angle between Y-axis & projection - Math.PI/2]
Joint4 = After finding Position of Blue & Red -> Angle between vector representing Link2 & vector representing Link3



AFTER TESTING:
For some reason Joint 1 moves horizontally. As such, the [0,0,0] point needs to be recalculated on every run.
